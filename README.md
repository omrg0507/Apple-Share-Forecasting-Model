# Apple-Share-Forecasting-Model

The project involved an examination and forecast of the stock prices of Apple Inc. It began with the preprocessing of data, including meticulous refinement and the application of feature engineering techniques to extract relevant insights from the raw dataset. Following this, a comprehensive exploratory data analysis was conducted to reveal valuable perspectives and clarify the complex relationships among various features and the target variable.

Next, five distinct machine learning models were developed to forecast stock prices. These models included a Baseline Model, LSTM, ARIMA, XGBoost, and SARIMA. A thorough evaluation of their performance was performed using a variety of metrics such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and R-squared score.

The results of the analysis indicated that both the LSTM and XGBoost models delivered the best performance, with the lowest mean squared error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error, as well as the highest R-squared score. The SARIMA model also showed promise, suggesting that further optimization and fine-tuning could lead to improved results in the future.
